# ArduinoUnleashed
This repository is part of the Arduino Unleashed Openmodule.

## Adding the Unleashed platform
To add the Unleashed board to your Arduino environment copy the WdKA folder over into a folder called hardware in your Arduino sketches directory.
After (re)starting the Arduino IDE under boards you will find a new Board called ''Arduino Unleashed Uno''.
